### Dataset
Link: [Dataset (CameraFusion+Nikon)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XTxU6iPxs_MZTM8g_hUsq0REWqB0P-AB)

We use the CameraFusion dataset becasue it support both single-image models (e.g. SRGAN) and single-reference models with dual zoomed observation (e.g. SelfDZSR). 

This is already pre-processed, so the images should be ready-to-use, saving time for image pre-processing.
